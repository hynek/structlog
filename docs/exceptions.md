# Exceptions

While you should use a proper crash reporter like [Sentry](https://sentry.io) in production, *structlog* has helpers for formatting exceptions for humans and machines.

All *structlog*'s exception features center around passing an `exc_info` key-value pair in the event dict.
There are three possible behaviors depending on its value:

1. If the value is a tuple, render it as if it was returned by {func}`sys.exc_info`.
2. If the value is an Exception, render it.
3. If the value is true but no tuple, call {func}`sys.exc_info` and render that.

If there is no `exc_info` key or false, the event dict is not touched.
This behavior is analog to the one of the stdlib's logging.


## Transformations

*structlog* comes with {class}`structlog.processors.ExceptionRenderer` that deduces and removes the `exc_info` key as outlined above, calls a user-supplied function with the synthesized `exc_info`, and stores its return value in the `exception` key.
The most common use-cases are already covered by the following processors:

{func}`structlog.processors.format_exc_info`

: Formats it to a flat string like the standard library would on the console.

{obj}`structlog.processors.dict_tracebacks`

: Uses {class}`structlog.tracebacks.ExceptionDictTransformer` to give you a structured and JSON-serializable `exception` key.


## Console rendering

Our {doc}`console-output`'s {class}`structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer` takes an *exception_formatter* argument that allows for customizing the output of exceptions.

{func}`structlog.dev.plain_traceback`

: Is the default if neither [Rich] nor [*better-exceptions*] nor [*pretty-traceback*] are installed.
  As the name suggests, it renders a plain traceback.

{func}`structlog.dev.better_traceback`

: Uses [*better-exceptions*] to render a colorful traceback.
: It's the default if *better-exceptions* is installed and Rich is not.

{class}`structlog.dev.RichTracebackFormatter`

: Uses [Rich] to render a colorful traceback.
  It's a class because it allows for customizing the output by passing arguments to Rich.
: It's the default if Rich is installed.
