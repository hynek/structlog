``structlog`` makes logging in Python **faster**, **less painful**, and **more powerful** by adding **structure** to your log entries.
It has been successfully used in production at every scale since **2013**, while embracing cutting-edge technologies like *asyncio* or type hints along the way, and `influenced the design <https://twitter.com/sirupsen/status/638330548361019392>`_ of `structured logging packages in other ecosystems <https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus>`_.

Thanks to its highly flexible design, it's up to you whether you want ``structlog`` to take care about the **output** of your log entries or whether you prefer to **forward** them to an existing logging system like the standard library's ``logging`` module.

``structlog`` comes with support for JSON, `logfmt <https://brandur.org/logfmt>`_, as well as pretty console output out-of-the-box:

A short explanation on *why* structured logging is good for you, and why ``structlog`` is the right tool for the job can be found in the `Why chapter <https://www.structlog.org/en/stable/why.html>`_ of our documentation.

Once you feel inspired to try it out, check out our friendly `Getting Started tutorial <https://www.structlog.org/en/stable/getting-started.html>`_ that also contains detailed installation instructions!

If you prefer videos over reading, check out `Markus Holtermann <https://twitter.com/m_holtermann>`_'s DjangoCon Europe 2019 talk: `Logging Rethought 2: The Actions of Frank Taylor Jr. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5eyEgyHLLo>`_
