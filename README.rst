``structlog`` makes structured logging in Python easy by *augmenting* your *existing* logger.
It allows you to split your log entries up into key/value pairs and build them incrementally without annoying boilerplate code.

``structlog`` targets Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, and PyPy with no additional dependencies for core functionality.
