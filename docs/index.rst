- If you can't wait to log your first entry, start at `getting-started` and then work yourself through the basic docs.

Integration with Existing Systems
---------------------------------

``structlog`` can be used immediately with *any* existing logger, or with the one with that it ships.
However it comes with special wrappers for the Python standard library and Twisted that are optimized for their respective underlying loggers and contain less magic.
