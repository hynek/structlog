Changelog
=========

Versions follow `Calendar Versioning <https://calver.org>`_ with a strict backwards-compatibility policy.

The **first number** of the version is the year.
The **second number** is incremented with each release, starting at 1 for each year.
The **third number** is when we need to start branches for older releases (only for emergencies).

You shouldn't ever be afraid to upgrade ``structlog`` if you're using its public APIs and pay attention to ``DeprecationWarning``\ s.
Whenever there is a need to break compatibility, it is announced here in the changelog and raises a ``DeprecationWarning`` for a year (if possible) before it's finally really broken.

.. warning::

   You cannot rely on the default settings and the `structlog.dev` module.
   They may be adjusted in the future to provide a better experience when starting to use ``structlog``.
   So please make sure to **always** properly configure your applications.

22.1.0 (UNRELEASED)
-------------------

Backward-incompatible changes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Python 3.6 is not supported anymore.
- Pickling is now only possible with protocol version 3 and newer.
- ``structlog.make_filtering_bound_logger()`` now returns a method with the same signature for all log levels, whether they are active or not.
  This ensures that invalid calls to inactive log levels are caught immediately and don't explode once the log level changes.
  `#401 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/401>`_


Deprecations:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*none*


Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- Overloaded the ``bind``, ``unbind``, ``try_unbind`` and ``new`` methods in the ``FilteringBoundLogger`` `Protocol <https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Protocol>`_.
  This makes it easier to use objects of type ``FilteringBoundLogger`` in a typed context.
  `#392 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/392>`_
- ``structlog.processors.StackInfoRenderer`` now has an *additional_ignores* parameter that allows you to filter out your own logging layer.
  `#396 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/396>`_
- ``structlog.PrintLogger`` -- that is used by default -- now uses ``print()`` for printing, making it a better citizen for interactive terminal applications.
  `#399 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/399>`_
- Added ``structlog.WriteLogger``, a faster but more low-level alternative to ``structlog.PrintLogger``.
  `#403 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/403>`_

21.5.0 (2021-12-16)
-------------------


Backward-incompatible changes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*none*


Deprecations:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*none*


Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- Added the ``structlog.processors.LogfmtRenderer`` processor to render log lines using the `logfmt <https://brandur.org/logfmt>`_ format.
  `#376 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/376>`_
- Added the ``structlog.stdlib.ExtraAdder`` processor that adds extra attributes of ``logging.LogRecord`` objects to the event dictionary.
  This processor can be used for adding data passed in the ``extra`` parameter of the ``logging`` module's log methods to the event dictionary.
  `#209 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/209>`_
  `#377 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/377>`_
- Added the ``structlog.processor.CallsiteParameterAdder`` processor that adds parameters of the callsite that an event dictionary orginated from to the event dictionary.
  This processor can be used to enrich events dictionaries with information such as the function name, line number and filename that an event dictionary orignated from.
  `#380 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/380>`_

21.4.0 (2021-11-25)
-------------------


Backward-incompatible changes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*none*


Deprecations:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*none*


Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- Fixed import when running in optimized mode (``PYTHONOPTIMIZE=2`` or ``python -OO``).
  `#373 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/373>`_
- Added the ``structlog.threadlocal.bound_threadlocal`` and ``structlog.contextvars.bound_contextvars`` decorator/context managers to temporarily bind key/value pairs to a thread-local and context-local context.
  `#371 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/371>`_


----


21.3.0 (2021-11-20)
-------------------


Backward-incompatible changes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``structlog`` switched its packaging to `flit <https://flit.readthedocs.io/>`_.
  Users shouldn't notice a difference, but (re-)packagers might.


Deprecations:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*none*


Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- ``structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer`` now has ``sort_keys`` boolean parameter that allows to disable the sorting of keys on output.
  `#358 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/358>`_
- ``structlog.processors.TimeStamper`` now works well with FreezeGun even when it gets applied before the loggers are configured.
  `#364 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/364>`_
- ``structlog.stdlib.AsyncBoundLogger`` now determines the running loop when logging, not on instantiation.
  That has a minor performance impact, but makes it more robust when loops change (e.g. ``aiohttp.web.run_app()``), or you want to use ``sync_bl`` *before* a loop has started.
- ``structlog.stdlib.ProcessorFormatter`` now has a *processors* argument that allows to define a processor chain to run over *all* log entries.

  Before running the chain, two additional keys are added to the event dictionary: ``_record`` and ``_from_structlog``.
  With them it's possible to extract information from ``logging.LogRecord``\s and differentiate between ``structlog`` and ``logging`` log entries while processing them.

  The old *processor* (singular) parameter is now deprecated, but no plans exist to remove it.
  `#365 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/365>`_


----


21.2.0 (2021-10-12)
-------------------


Backward-incompatible changes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- To implement pretty exceptions (see Changes below), ``structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer`` now formats exceptions itself.

  Make sure to remove ``format_exc_info`` from your processor chain if you configure ``structlog`` manually.
  This change is not really breaking, because the old use-case will keep working as before.
  However if you pass ``pretty_exceptions=True`` (which is the default if either ``rich`` or ``better-exceptions`` is installed), a warning will be raised and the exception will be renderered without prettyfication.


Deprecations:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*none*


Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- ``structlog`` is now importable if ``sys.stdout`` is ``None`` (e.g. when running using ``pythonw``).
  `#313 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/313>`_
- ``structlog.threadlocal.get_threadlocal()`` and ``structlog.contextvars.get_contextvars()`` can now be used to get a copy of the current thread-local/context-local context that has been bound using ``structlog.threadlocal.bind_threadlocal()`` and ``structlog.contextvars.bind_contextvars()``.
  `#331 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/331>`_
  `#337 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/337>`_
- ``structlog.threadlocal.get_merged_threadlocal(bl)`` and ``structlog.contextvars.get_merged_contextvars(bl)`` do the same, but also merge the context from a bound logger *bl*.
  Same pull requests as previous change.
- ``structlog.contextvars.bind_contextvars()`` now returns a mapping of keys to ``contextvars.Token``\s, allowing you to reset values using the new ``structlog.contextvars.reset_contextvars()``.
  `#339 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/339>`_
- Exception rendering in ``structlog.dev.ConsoleLogger`` is now configurable using the ``exception_formatter`` setting.
  If either the `rich <https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich>`_ or the `better-exceptions <https://github.com/qix-/better-exceptions>`_ package is present, ``structlog`` will use them for pretty-printing tracebacks.
  ``rich`` takes precedence over ``better-exceptions`` if both are present.

  This only works if ``format_exc_info`` is **absent** in the processor chain.
  `#330 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/330>`_
  `#349 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/349>`_
- All use of ``colorama`` on non-Windows systems has been excised.
  Thus, colors are now enabled by default in ``structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer`` on non-Windows systems.
  You can keep using ``colorama`` to customize colors, of course.
  `#345 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/345>`_
- The final processor can now return a ``bytearray`` (additionally to ``str`` and ``bytes``).
  `#344 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/344>`_

21.1.0 (2021-02-18)
-------------------


Backward-incompatible changes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*none*


Deprecations:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*none*


Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- ``structlog.threadlocal.wrap_dict()`` now has a correct type annotation.
  `#290 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/290>`_
- Fix isolation in ``structlog.contextvars``.
  `#302 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/302>`_
- The default configuration and loggers are pickleable again.
  `#301 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/301>`_
- ``structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer`` will now look for a ``logger_name`` key if no
  ``logger`` key is set.
  `#295 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/295>`_


----


20.2.0 (2020-12-31)
-------------------


Backward-incompatible changes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Python 2.7 and 3.5 aren't supported anymore.
  The package meta data should ensure that you keep getting 20.1.0 on those versions.
  `#244 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/244>`_

- ``structlog`` is now fully type-annotated.
  This won't break your applications, but if you use Mypy, it will most likely break your CI.

  Check out the new chapter on typing for details.

- The default bound logger (``wrapper_class``) if you don't configure ``structlog`` has changed.
  It's mostly compatible with the old one but a few uncommon methods like ``log``, ``failure``, or ``err`` don't exist anymore.

  You can regain the old behavior by using ``structlog.configure(wrapper_class=structlog.BoundLogger)``.

  Please note that due to the various interactions between settings, it's possible that you encounter even more errors.
  We **strongly** urge you to always configure all possible settings since the default configuration is *not* covered by our backwards-compatibility policy.


Deprecations:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Accessing the ``_context`` attribute of a bound logger is now deprecated.
  Please use the new ``structlog.get_context()``.


Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- ``structlog`` has now type hints for all of its APIs!
  Since ``structlog`` is highly dynamic and configurable, this led to a few concessions like a specialized ``structlog.stdlib.get_logger()`` whose only difference to ``structlog.get_logger()`` is that it has the correct type hints.

  We consider them provisional for the time being – i.e. the backwards-compatibility does not apply to them in its full strength until we feel we got it right.
  Please feel free to provide feedback!
  `#223 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/223>`_,
  `#282 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/282>`_
- Added ``structlog.make_filtering_logger`` that can be used like ``configure(wrapper_class=make_filtering_bound_logger(logging.INFO))``.
  It creates a highly optimized bound logger whose inactive methods only consist of a ``return None``.
  This is now also the default logger.
- As a complement, ``structlog.stdlib.add_log_level()`` can now additionally be imported as ``structlog.processors.add_log_level`` since it just adds the method name to the event dict.
- ``structlog.processors.add_log_level()`` is now part of the default configuration.
- ``structlog.stdlib.ProcessorFormatter`` no longer uses exceptions for control flow, allowing ``foreign_pre_chain`` processors to use ``sys.exc_info()`` to access the real exception.
- Added ``structlog.BytesLogger`` to avoid unnecessary encoding round trips.
  Concretely this is useful with *orjson* which returns bytes.
  `#271 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/271>`_
- The final processor now also may return bytes that are passed untouched to the wrapped logger.
- ``structlog.get_context()`` allows you to retrieve the original context of a bound logger.
  `#266 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/266>`_,
- ``structlog.PrintLogger`` now supports ``copy.deepcopy()``.
  `#268 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/268>`_
- Added ``structlog.testing.CapturingLogger`` for more unit testing goodness.
- Added ``structlog.stdlib.AsyncBoundLogger`` that executes logging calls in a thread executor and therefore doesn't block.
  `#245 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/245>`_


----


20.1.0 (2020-01-28)
-------------------


Backward-incompatible changes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*none*


Deprecations:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- This is the last version to support Python 2.7 (including PyPy) and 3.5.
  All following versions will only support Python 3.6 or later.


Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- Added a new module ``structlog.contextvars`` that allows to have a global but context-local ``structlog`` context the same way as with ``structlog.threadlocal`` since 19.2.0.
  `#201 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/201>`_,
  `#236 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/236>`_
- Added a new module ``structlog.testing`` for first class testing support.
  The first entry is the context manager ``capture_logs()`` that allows to make assertions about structured log calls.
  `#14 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/14>`_,
  `#234 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/234>`_
- Added ``structlog.threadlocal.unbind_threadlocal()``.
  `#239 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/239>`_
- The logger created by ``structlog.get_logger()`` is not detected as an abstract method anymore, when attached to an abstract base class.
  `#229 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/229>`_
- ``colorama`` isn't initialized lazily on Windows anymore because it breaks rendering.
  `#232 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/232>`_,
  `#242 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/242>`_


----


19.2.0 (2019-10-16)
-------------------


Backward-incompatible changes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Python 3.4 is not supported anymore.
  It has been unsupported by the Python core team for a while now and its PyPI downloads are negligible.

  It's very unlikely that ``structlog`` will break under 3.4 anytime soon, but we don't test it anymore.


Deprecations:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*none*


Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- Full Python 3.8 support for ``structlog.stdlib``.
- Added more pass-through properties to ``structlog.stdlib.BoundLogger``.
  To makes it easier to use it as a drop-in replacement for ``logging.Logger``.
  `#198 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/198>`_
- ``structlog.stdlib.ProcessorFormatter`` now takes a logger object as an optional keyword argument.
  This makes ``ProcessorFormatter`` work properly with ``stuctlog.stdlib.filter_by_level()``.
  `#219 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/219>`_
- ``structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer`` now uses no colors by default, if ``colorama`` is not available.
  `#215 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/215>`_
- ``structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer`` now initializes ``colorama`` lazily, to prevent accidental side-effects just by importing ``structlog``.
  `#210 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/210>`_
- Added new processor ``structlog.dev.set_exc_info()`` that will set ``exc_info=True`` if the method's name is ``exception`` and ``exc_info`` isn't set at all.
  *This is only necessary when the standard library integration is not used*.
  It fixes the problem that in the default configuration, ``structlog.get_logger().exception("hi")`` in an ``except`` block would not print the exception without passing ``exc_info=True`` to it explicitly.
  `#130 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/130>`_,
  `#173 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/173>`_,
  `#200 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/200>`_,
  `#204 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/204>`_
- A best effort has been made to make as much of ``structlog`` pickleable as possible to make it friendlier with ``multiprocessing`` and similar libraries.
  Some classes can only be pickled on Python 3 or using the `dill <https://pypi.org/project/dill/>`_ library though and that is very unlikely to change.

  So far, the configuration proxy, ``structlog.processor.TimeStamper``, ``structlog.BoundLogger``, ``structlog.PrintLogger`` and ``structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer`` have been made pickelable.
  Please report if you need any another class fixed.
  `#126 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/126>`_
- Added a new thread-local API that allows binding values to a thread-local context explicitly without affecting the default behavior of ``bind()``.
  `#222 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/222>`_,
  `#225 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/225>`_
- Added ``pass_foreign_args`` argument to ``structlog.stdlib.ProcessorFormatter``.
  It allows to pass a foreign log record's ``args`` attribute to the event dictionary under the ``positional_args`` key.
  `#228 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/228>`_
- ``structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer`` now calls ``str()`` on the event value.
  `#221 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/221>`_


----


19.1.0 (2019-02-02)
-------------------


Backward-incompatible changes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- As announced in 18.1.0, ``pip install -e .[dev]`` now installs all development dependencies.
  Sorry for the inconveniences this undoubtedly will cause!


Deprecations:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*none*


Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- ``structlog.ReturnLogger`` and ``structlog.PrintLogger`` now have a ``fatal()`` log method.
  `#181 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/181>`_
- Under certain (rather unclear) circumstances, the frame extraction could throw an ``SystemError: error return without exception set``.
  A workaround has been added.
  `#174 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/174>`_
- ``structlog`` now tolerates passing through ``dict``\ s to stdlib logging.
  `#187 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/187>`_,
  `#188 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/188>`_,
  `#189 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/189>`_

18.2.0 (2018-09-05)
-------------------


Backward-incompatible changes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*none*


Deprecations:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*none*


Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- Added ``structlog.stdlib.add_log_level_number()`` processor that adds the level *number* to the event dictionary.
  Can be used to simplify log filtering.
  `#151 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/151>`_
- ``structlog.processors.JSONRenderer`` now allows for overwriting the *default* argument of its serializer.
  `#77 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/77>`_,
  `#163 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/163>`_
- Added ``try_unbind()`` that works like ``unbind()`` but doesn't raise a ``KeyError`` if one of the keys is missing.
  `#171 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/171>`_


----


18.1.0 (2018-01-27)
-------------------


Backward-incompatible changes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*none*


Deprecations:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The meaning of the ``structlog[dev]`` installation target will change from "colorful output" to "dependencies to develop ``structlog``" in 19.1.0.

  The main reason behind this decision is that it's impossible to have a ``structlog`` in your normal dependencies and additionally a ``structlog[dev]`` for development (``pip`` will report an error).


Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- Empty strings are valid events now.
  `#110 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/110>`_
- Do not encapsulate Twisted failures twice with newer versions of Twisted.
  `#144 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/144>`_
- ``structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer`` now accepts a *force_colors* argument to output colored logs even if the destination is not a tty.
  Use this option if your logs are stored in files that are intended to be streamed to the console.
- ``structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer`` now accepts a *level_styles* argument for overriding the colors for individual levels, as well as to add new levels.
  See the docs for ``ConsoleRenderer.get_default_level_styles()`` for usage.
  `#139 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/139>`_
- ``structlog.stdlib.BoundLogger.exception()`` now uses the ``exc_info`` argument if it has been passed instead of setting it unconditionally to ``True``.
  `#149 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/149>`_
- Default configuration now uses plain ``dict``\ s on Python 3.6+ and PyPy since they are ordered by default.
- Added ``structlog.is_configured()`` to check whether or not ``structlog`` has been configured.
- Added ``structlog.get_config()`` to introspect current configuration.

17.2.0 (2017-05-15)
-------------------


Backward-incompatible changes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*none*


Deprecations:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*none*


Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- ``structlog.stdlib.ProcessorFormatter`` now accepts *keep_exc_info* and *keep_stack_info* arguments to control what to do with this information on log records.
  Most likely you want them both to be ``False`` therefore it's the default.
  `#109 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/109>`_
- ``structlog.stdlib.add_logger_name()`` now works in ``structlog.stdlib.ProcessorFormatter``'s ``foreign_pre_chain``.
  `#112 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/112>`_
- Clear log record args in ``structlog.stdlib.ProcessorFormatter`` after rendering.
  This fix is for you if you tried to use it and got ``TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting`` exceptions.
  `#116 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/116>`_,
  `#117 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/117>`_


----


17.1.0 (2017-04-24)
-------------------

The main features of this release are massive improvements in standard library's ``logging`` integration.
Have a look at the updated `standard library chapter <https://www.structlog.org/en/stable/standard-library.html>`_ on how to use them!
Special thanks go to
`Fabian Büchler <https://github.com/fabianbuechler>`_,
`Gilbert Gilb's <https://github.com/gilbsgilbs>`_,
`Iva Kaneva <https://github.com/if-fi>`_,
`insolite <https://github.com/insolite>`_,
and `sky-code <https://github.com/sky-code>`_,
that made them possible.


Backward-incompatible changes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The default renderer now is ``structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer`` if you don't configure ``structlog``.
  Colors are used if available and human-friendly timestamps are prepended.
  This is in line with our backwards-compatibility policy that explicitly excludes default settings.


Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- Added ``structlog.stdlib.render_to_log_kwargs()``.
  This allows you to use ``logging``-based formatters to take care of rendering your entries.
  `#98 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/98>`_
- Added ``structlog.stdlib.ProcessorFormatter`` which does the opposite:
  This allows you to run ``structlog`` processors on arbitrary ``logging.LogRecords``.
  `#79 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/79>`_,
  `#105 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/105>`_
- UNIX epoch timestamps from ``structlog.processors.TimeStamper`` are more precise now.
- Added *repr_native_str* to ``structlog.processors.KeyValueRenderer`` and ``structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer``.
  This allows for human-readable non-ASCII output on Python 2 (``repr()`` on Python 2 behaves like ``ascii()`` on Python 3 in that regard).
  As per compatibility policy, it's on (original behavior) in ``KeyValueRenderer`` and off (humand-friendly behavior) in ``ConsoleRenderer``.
  `#94 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/94>`_
- Added *colors* argument to ``structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer`` and made it the default renderer.
  `#78 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/78>`_
- Fixed bug with Python 3 and ``structlog.stdlib.BoundLogger.log()``.
  Error log level was not reproductible and was logged as exception one time out of two.
  `#92 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/92>`_
- Positional arguments are now removed even if they are empty.
  `#82 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/82>`_


----


16.1.0 (2016-05-24)
-------------------

Backward-incompatible changes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Python 3.3 and 2.6 aren't supported anymore.
  They may work by chance but any effort to keep them working has ceased.

  The last Python 2.6 release was on October 29, 2013 and isn't supported by the CPython core team anymore.
  Major Python packages like Django and Twisted dropped Python 2.6 a while ago already.

  Python 3.3 never had a significant user base and wasn't part of any distribution's LTS release.

Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- Add a ``drop_missing`` argument to ``KeyValueRenderer``.
  If ``key_order`` is used and a key is missing a value, it's not rendered at all instead of being rendered as ``None``.
  `#67 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/67>`_
- Exceptions without a ``__traceback__`` are now also rendered on Python 3.
- Don't cache loggers in lazy proxies returned from ``get_logger()``.
  This lead to in-place mutation of them if used before configuration which in turn lead to the problem that configuration was applied only partially to them later.
  `#72 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/72>`_


----


16.0.0 (2016-01-28)
-------------------

Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- ``structlog.processors.ExceptionPrettyPrinter`` and ``structlog.processors.format_exc_info`` now support passing of Exceptions on Python 3.
- Clean up the context when exiting ``structlog.threadlocal.tmp_bind`` in case of exceptions.
  `#64 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/64>`_
- Be more more lenient about missing ``__name__``\ s.
  `#62 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/62>`_
- Add ``structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer`` that renders the event dictionary aligned and with colors.
- Use `six <https://six.readthedocs.io/>`_ for compatibility.
- Add ``structlog.processors.UnicodeDecoder`` that will decode all byte string values in an event dictionary to Unicode.
- Add ``serializer`` parameter to ``structlog.processors.JSONRenderer`` which allows for using different (possibly faster) JSON encoders than the standard library.


----


15.3.0 (2015-09-25)
-------------------

Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- Tolerate frames without a ``__name__``, better.
  `#58 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/58>`_
- Officially support Python 3.5.
- Add ``structlog.ReturnLogger.failure`` and ``structlog.PrintLogger.failure`` as preparation for the new Twisted logging system.


----


15.2.0 (2015-06-10)
-------------------

Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- Allow empty lists of processors.
  This is a valid use case since `#26 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/issues/26>`_ has been merged.
  Before, supplying an empty list resulted in the defaults being used.
- Prevent Twisted's ``log.err`` from quoting strings rendered by ``structlog.twisted.JSONRenderer``.
- Better support of ``logging.Logger.exception`` within ``structlog``.
  `#52 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/52>`_
- Add option to specify target key in ``structlog.processors.TimeStamper`` processor.
  `#51 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/51>`_


----


15.1.0 (2015-02-24)
-------------------

Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- Tolerate frames without a ``__name__``.


----


15.0.0 (2015-01-23)
-------------------

Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- Add ``structlog.stdlib.add_log_level`` and ``structlog.stdlib.add_logger_name`` processors.
  `#44 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/44>`_
- Add ``structlog.stdlib.BoundLogger.log``.
  `#42 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/42>`_
- Pass positional arguments to stdlib wrapped loggers that use string formatting.
  `#19 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/19>`_
- ``structlog`` is now dually licensed under the `Apache License, Version 2 <https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache/>`_ and the `MIT <https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/>`_ license.
  Therefore it is now legal to use structlog with `GPLv2 <https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-2.0/>`_-licensed projects.
  `#28 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/28>`_
- Add ``structlog.stdlib.BoundLogger.exception``.
  `#22 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/22>`_


----


0.4.2 (2014-07-26)
------------------

Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- Fixed a memory leak in greenlet code that emulates thread locals.
  It shouldn't matter in practice unless you use multiple wrapped dicts within one program that is rather unlikely.
  `#8 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/8>`_
- ``structlog.PrintLogger`` now is thread-safe.
- Test Twisted-related code on Python 3 (with some caveats).
- Drop support for Python 3.2.
  There is no justification to add complexity for a Python version that nobody uses.
  If you are one of the `0.350% <https://alexgaynor.net/2014/jan/03/pypi-download-statistics/>`_ that use Python 3.2, please stick to the 0.4 branch; critical bugs will still be fixed.
- Officially support Python 3.4.
- Allow final processor to return a dictionary.
  See the adapting chapter.
  `#26`_
- ``from structlog import *`` works now (but you still shouldn't use it).


----


0.4.1 (2013-12-19)
------------------

Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- Don't cache proxied methods in ``structlog.threadlocal._ThreadLocalDictWrapper``.
  This doesn't affect regular users.
- Various doc fixes.


----


0.4.0 (2013-11-10)
------------------


Backward-incompatible changes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- Add ``structlog.processors.StackInfoRenderer`` for adding stack information to log entries without involving exceptions.
  Also added it to default processor chain.
  `#6 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/6>`_
- Allow optional positional arguments for ``structlog.get_logger`` that are passed to logger factories.
  The standard library factory uses this for explicit logger naming.
  `#12 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/12>`_
- Add ``structlog.processors.ExceptionPrettyPrinter`` for development and testing when multiline log entries aren't just acceptable but even helpful.
- Allow the standard library name guesser to ignore certain frame names.
  This is useful together with frameworks.
- Add meta data (e.g. function names, line numbers) extraction for wrapped stdlib loggers.
  `#5 <https://github.com/hynek/structlog/pull/5>`_


----


0.3.2 (2013-09-27)
------------------

Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- Fix stdlib's name guessing.


----


0.3.1 (2013-09-26)
------------------

Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- Add forgotten ``structlog.processors.TimeStamper`` to API documentation.


----


0.3.0 (2013-09-23)
------------------

Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- Greatly enhanced and polished the documentation and added a new theme based on Write The Docs, requests, and Flask.
- Add Python Standard Library-specific BoundLogger that has an explicit API instead of intercepting unknown method calls.
  See ``structlog.stdlib.BoundLogger``.
- ``structlog.ReturnLogger`` now allows arbitrary positional and keyword arguments.
- Add Twisted-specific BoundLogger that has an explicit API instead of intercepting unknown method calls.
  See ``structlog.twisted.BoundLogger``.
- Allow logger proxies that are returned by ``structlog.get_logger`` and ``structlog.wrap_logger`` to cache the BoundLogger they assemble according to configuration on first use.
  See the chapter on performance and the ``cache_logger_on_first_use`` argument of ``structlog.configure`` and ``structlog.wrap_logger``.
- Extract a common base class for loggers that does nothing except keeping the context state.
  This makes writing custom loggers much easier and more straight-forward.
  See ``structlog.BoundLoggerBase``.


----


0.2.0 (2013-09-17)
------------------

Changes:
^^^^^^^^

- Promote to stable, thus henceforth a strict backwards-compatibility policy is put into effect.
- Add ``key_order`` option to ``structlog.processors.KeyValueRenderer`` for more predictable log entries with any ``dict`` class.
- ``structlog.PrintLogger`` now uses proper I/O routines and is thus viable not only for examples but also for production.
- Enhance Twisted support by offering JSONification of non-structlog log entries.
- Allow for custom serialization in ``structlog.twisted.JSONRenderer`` without abusing ``__repr__``.


----


0.1.0 (2013-09-16)
------------------

Initial release.
