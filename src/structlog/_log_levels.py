    Create a new `FilteringBoundLogger` that only logs *min_level* or higher.

    The logger is optimized such that log levels below *min_level* only consist
    of a ``return None``.

    Compared to using ``structlog``'s standard library integration and the
    `structlog.stdlib.filter_by_level` processor:

    - It's faster because once the logger is built at program start, it's a
      static class.
    - For the same reason you can't change the log level once configured.
      Use the dynamic approach of `standard-library` instead, if you need this
      feature.

    :param min_level: The log level as an integer. You can use the constants
        from `logging` like ``logging.INFO`` or pass the values directly. See
        `this table from the logging docs
        <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#levels>`_ for possible
