…Structured Logging?
====================

      I believe the widespread use of format strings in logging is based on two presumptions:

      - The first level consumer of a log message is a human.
      - The programmer knows what information is needed to debug an issue.

      I believe these presumptions are **no longer correct** in server side software.

      ---`Paul Querna`_

Structured logging means that you don't write hard-to-parse and hard-to-keep-consistent prose in your logs but that you log *events* that happen in a *context* instead.
