Configuration
=============


Global Defaults
---------------

To make logging as unintrusive and straight-forward to use as possible, structlog comes with a plethora of configuration options and convenience functions.
Let me start at the end and introduce you to the ultimate convenience function that relies purely on configuration: :func:`structlog.get_logger` (and its Twisted-friendly alias :func:`structlog.getLogger`).

The goal is to reduce your per-file logging boilerplate to::

   from structlog.stdlib import get_logger
   logger = get_logger()

while still giving you the full power via configuration.

To achieve that you'll have to call :func:`structlog.configure` on app initialization (of course, only if you're not content with the defaults).
The previous example could thus have been written as following:

.. testcleanup:: *

   import structlog
   structlog.reset_defaults()

.. testsetup:: config_wrap_logger, config_get_logger

   from structlog import PrintLogger, configure, reset_defaults, wrap_logger, get_logger
   from structlog.threadlocal import wrap_dict
   def proc(logger, method_name, event_dict):
      print 'I got called with', event_dict
      return repr(event_dict)

.. doctest:: config_wrap_logger

   >>> configure(processors=[proc], context_class=dict)
   >>> log = wrap_logger(PrintLogger())
   >>> log.msg('hello world')
   I got called with {'event': 'hello world'}
   {'event': 'hello world'}

In fact, it could even be written like

.. doctest:: config_get_logger

   >>> configure(processors=[proc], context_class=dict)
   >>> log = get_logger()
   >>> log.msg('hello world')
   I got called with {'event': 'hello world'}
   {'event': 'hello world'}

because :class:`~structlog.processors.PrintLogger` is the default LoggerFactory used (see :ref:`logger-factories`).

structlog tries to behave in the least surprising way when it comes to handling defaults and configuration:

#. Arguments passed to :func:`structlog.wrap_logger` *always* take the highest precedence over configuration.
   That means that you can overwrite whatever you've configured for each logger respectively.
#. If you leave them on `None`, structlog will check whether you've configured default values using :func:`structlog.configure` and uses them if so.
#. If you haven't configured or passed anything at all, the default fallback values are used which means OrderedDict_ for context and ``[``:func:`~structlog.processors.format_exc_info`, :class:`~structlog.processors.KeyValueRenderer`\ ``]`` for the processor chain, and `False` for `cache_logger_on_first_use`.

If necessary, you can always reset your global configuration back to default values using :func:`structlog.reset_defaults`.
That can be handy in tests.

.. note::

   Since you will call :func:`structlog.wrap_logger` (or one of the ``get_logger()`` functions) most likely at import time and thus before you had a chance to configure structlog, they return a **proxy** that returns a correct wrapped logger on first ``bind()``/``new()``.

   Therefore, you must not call ``new()`` or ``bind()`` in module scope!
   Use :func:`~structlog.get_logger`\ 's ``initial_values`` to achieve pre-populated contexts.

   To enable you to log with the module-global logger, it will create a temporary BoundLogger and relay the log calls to it on *each call*.
   Therefore if you have nothing to bind but intend to do lots of log calls in a function, it makes sense performance-wise to create a local logger by calling ``bind()`` or ``new()`` without any parameters.
   See also :doc:`performance`.


.. _logger-factories:

Logger Factories
----------------

To make :func:`structlog.get_logger` work, one needs one more option that hasn't been discussed yet: ``logger_factory``.

It is a callable that returns the logger that gets wrapped and returned.
In the simplest case, it's a function that returns a logger -- or just a class.
But you can also pass in an instance of a class with a ``__call__`` method for more complicated setups.

For the common cases of standard library logging and Twisted logging, structlog comes with two factories built right in:

- :class:`structlog.stdlib.LoggerFactory`
- :class:`structlog.twisted.LoggerFactory`

So all it takes to use structlog with standard library logging is this::

   >>> from structlog import get_logger, configure
   >>> from structlog.stdlib import LoggerFactory
   >>> configure(logger_factory=LoggerFactory())
   >>> log = get_logger()
   >>> log.critical('this is too easy!')
   event='this is too easy!'

This uses a custom logger in order to override the default findCaller() so that it displays the correct caller.


The :ref:`Twisted example <twisted-example>` shows how easy it is for Twisted.

.. note::

   `LoggerFactory()`-style factories always need to get passed as *instances* like in the examples above.
   While neither allows for customization using parameters yet, they may do so in the future.

Calling :func:`structlog.get_logger` without configuration gives you a perfectly useful :class:`structlog.PrintLogger` with the default values exaplained above.
I don't believe silent loggers are a sensible default.


Where to Configure
------------------

The best place to perform your configuration varies with applications and frameworks.
Ideally as late as possible but *before* non-framework (i.e. your) code is executed.
If you use standard library's logging, it makes sense to configure them next to each other.

**Django**
   Django has to date unfortunately no concept of an application assembler or "app is done" hooks.
   Therefore the bottom of your ``settings.py`` will have to do.

**Flask**
   See `Logging Application Errors <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/errorhandling/>`_.

**Pyramid**
   `Application constructor <http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/narr/startup.html#the-startup-process>`_.

**Twisted**
   The `plugin definition <http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/plugin.html>`_ is the best place.
   If your app is not a plugin, put it into your `tac file <http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/application.html>`_ (and then `learn <https://bitbucket.org/jerub/twisted-plugin-example>`_ about plugins).

If you have no choice but *have* to configure on import time in module-global scope, or can't rule out for other reasons that that your :func:`structlog.configure` gets called more than once, structlog offers :func:`structlog.configure_once` that raises a warning if structlog has been configured before (no matter whether using :func:`structlog.configure` or :func:`~structlog.configure_once`) but doesn't change anything.
