Processors
==========

The true power of ``structlog`` lies in its *combinable log processors*.
A log processor is a regular callable, i.e. a function or an instance of a class with a ``__call__()`` method.

.. _chains:

Chains
------

The *processor chain* is a list of processors.
Each processors receives three positional arguments:

**logger**
   Your wrapped logger object.
   For example :class:`logging.Logger`.

**method_name**
   The name of the wrapped method.
   If you called ``log.warn('foo')``, it will be ``"warn"``.

**event_dict**
   Current context together with the current event.
   If the context was ``{'a': 42}`` and the event is ``"foo"``, the initial ``event_dict`` will be ``{'a':42, 'event': 'foo'}``.

The return value of each processor is passed on to the next one as ``event_dict`` until finally the return value of the last processor gets passed into the wrapped logging method.


Examples
^^^^^^^^

If you set up your logger like:

.. code:: python

   from structlog import PrintLogger, wrap_logger
   wrapped_logger = PrintLogger()
   logger = wrap_logger(wrapped_logger, processors=[f1, f2, f3, f4])
   log = logger.new(x=42)

and call ``log.msg('some_event', y=23)``, it results in the following call chain:

.. code:: python

   wrapped_logger.msg(
      f4(wrapped_logger, 'msg',
         f3(wrapped_logger, 'msg',
            f2(wrapped_logger, 'msg',
               f1(wrapped_logger, 'msg', {'event': 'some_event', 'x': 42, 'y': 23})
            )
         )
      )
   )

In this case, ``f4`` has to make sure it returns something ``wrapped_logger.msg`` can handle (see :ref:`adapting`).

The simplest modification a processor can make is adding new values to the ``event_dict``.
Parsing human-readable timestamps is tedious, not so `UNIX timestamps <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX_time>`_ -- let's add one to each log entry!

.. literalinclude:: code_examples/processors/timestamper.py
   :language: python

Please note, that ``structlog`` comes with such an processor built in: :class:`~structlog.processors.TimeStamper`.


Filtering
---------

If a processor raises :exc:`structlog.DropEvent`, the event is silently dropped.

Therefore, the following processor drops every entry:

.. literalinclude:: code_examples/processors/dropper.py
   :language: python

But we can do better than that!

.. _cond_drop:

How about dropping only log entries that are marked as coming from a certain peer (e.g. monitoring)?

.. literalinclude:: code_examples/processors/conditional_dropper.py
   :language: python


.. _adapting:

Adapting and Rendering
----------------------

An important role is played by the *last* processor because its duty is to adapt the ``event_dict`` into something the underlying logging method understands.
With that, it's also the *only* processor that needs to know anything about the underlying system.

It can return one of three types:

- A string that is passed as the first (and only) positional argument to the underlying logger.
- A tuple of ``(args, kwargs)`` that are passed as ``log_method(*args, **kwargs)``.
- A dictionary which is passed as ``log_method(**kwargs)``.

Therefore ``return 'hello world'`` is a shortcut for ``return (('hello world',), {})`` (the example in :ref:`chains` assumes this shortcut has been taken).

This should give you enough power to use ``structlog`` with any logging system while writing agnostic processors that operate on dictionaries.

.. versionchanged:: 14.0.0
   Allow final processor to return a `dict`.


Examples
^^^^^^^^

The probably most useful formatter for string based loggers is :class:`~structlog.processors.JSONRenderer`.
Advanced log aggregation and analysis tools like `logstash <https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash>`_ offer features like telling them “this is JSON, deal with it” instead of fiddling with regular expressions.

More examples can be found in the :ref:`examples <processors-examples>` chapter.
For a list of shipped processors, check out the :ref:`API documentation <procs>`.


Third Party Packages
--------------------

Since processors are self-contained callables,
it's easy to write your own and to share them in separate packages.
The following processor packages are known to be currently available on PyPI:

- `structlog-pretty <https://github.com/underyx/structlog-pretty>`_: Processors for prettier output -- a code syntax highlighter, JSON and XML prettifiers, a multiline string printer, and a numeric value rounder.

Please feel free to submit a pull request to extend this list with *your* package!
