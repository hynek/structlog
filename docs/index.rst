First steps:

- If you can't wait to log your first entry, start at `getting-started` and then work yourself through the basic docs.

Integration with Existing Systems
---------------------------------

``structlog`` can be used immediately with *any* existing logger.
However it comes with special wrappers for the Python standard library and Twisted that are optimized for their respective underlying loggers and contain less magic.
