If you’d like more information on why structured logging in general – and *structlog* in particular – are good ideas, we’ve prepared a [summary](why.md) just for you.

Otherwise, let’s dive right in!

why
```


## Basics

The first chapters teach you all you need to use *structlog* productively.
They build gently on each other, so ideally, read them in order.


```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 2

getting-started
bound-loggers
configuration
processors
contextvars
```


## Development Affordances

*structlog*'s focus is production systems, but it comes with **pretty console logging** and handy in-development helpers both for your **comfort** and your code's **quality**.

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 2
console-output
testing
typing
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

*structlog* is both zero-config as well as highly configurable.
You can use it on its own or integrate with existing systems.
Dedicated support for the standard library and Twisted is shipped out-of-the-box.
